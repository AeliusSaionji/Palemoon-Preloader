• The ReadMe.txt file has been divided into ReadMe.txt, Manual.html, and ChangeLog.txt for easier reading.
• The Preloader now uses the WaitForSingleObject method to wait until Firefox terminates before it tries to reload it.  This is added to increase the number of methods that the preloader uses to check for Firefox's status.  This should completely fix the empty window bug.
