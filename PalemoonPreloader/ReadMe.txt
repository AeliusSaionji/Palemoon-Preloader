It is recommended that you NOT use the "File->Exit" command to close Palemoon or it's windows unless you are installing new extensions or themes. This will unload Palemoon and defeat the purpose of this program.  Palemoon can be closed via 'File->Close' or the X button on the windows' title bar

Known Issues
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
• The Preloader doesn't insure that the firefox.exe file it is using is the real one.  This may be fixed in a later version by check the exe against a list of checksums of known released versions.
